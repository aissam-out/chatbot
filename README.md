ChatBots are conversational agents, programs capable of conducting a conversation with an Internet user. In this project we implemented WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger chatbots using Twilio plateform.

In addition to static chatbots, we also benefited from the power of Google's Dialogflow to create intelligent bots, capable of understanding human languages
