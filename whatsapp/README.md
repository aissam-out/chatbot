## Twilio

Twilio is a cloud communications platform as a service (CPaaS) company which allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.

With the Twilio API for WhatsApp, you can send notifications, have two-way conversations, or build chatbots. 

For free, and without waiting for your Twilio number to be approved for WhatsApp, Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp enables you to create your chatbot immediately as we are about to see in this project .
