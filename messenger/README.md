[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) is a cloud communications platform as a service (CPaaS) company which allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.

Before starting this project, make sure you have a Facebook Page for your brand or business, and the Messenger App installed in your phone. If so, the following steps will walk you through the process of creating and configuring your Facebook Messenger channel on Twilio, and then to link it with your FB page :

Make sure you have created an Autopilot assistant to power the Facebook Messenger Bot.

## Create and configure the Autopilot assistant

**1.** Create a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

**2.** Create a [new project](https://www.twilio.com/console/projects/create)
      
**3.** On project console, open **Autopilot**, then create a new bot _from scratch_ if you don't have one.

**4.** In the dashboard of your bot, select _Tasks_ on the left menu. 

A bot usually has many tasks that power it. These could be simple tasks like confirm or cancel or more complex tasks like make-a-reservation

**5.** CLick on _Add a task_ and give it a (meaningful) name. Create as many tasks as you need your bot to handle.

Every task has two main features _Program_ and _Train_
